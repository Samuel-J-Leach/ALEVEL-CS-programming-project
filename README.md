created for my A level computer science programming project which I completed in year 13.

it is an encrypted messaging app that connects directly to the other user's app so no 3rd party server is needed.

you can use existing encryption keys, or have it automatically generate encryption keys for you to use, or create your own with a built in menu.

you can also create a password for the app so only you can access it on your device.
